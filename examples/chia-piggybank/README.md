# Custom Asset Token (CAT) Example: Piggybank

These tutorials show how to write and interact with a â€œpiggybank" on the Chia Network. The piggybank is, itself, a Custom Asset Token (abbreviated "CAT", or colloquially just called a "custom coin") that increases in value when mojos are sent to it, without allowing any withdrawls until a pre-set savings target is met. Once the goal is met, the piggybank creates a new, spendable coin of that value and resets itself to zero so you can start saving again.
