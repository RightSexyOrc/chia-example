# Chialisp Developer Challenge

The Challenge runs for 24 hours, beginning at 12pm PST on February 3, 2022.

### A message from the Chia team: 

Welcome to Chia’s very first Developers Challenge!  

In preparation for this event we had planned to give a very specific prompt; however, as we began to set the judging criteria, we realized this may have been too restrictive for a 24 hour window. So instead, we are opening the prompt up to you. 

**Make us what you think is fun, creative, innovative, exciting! Everything boils down to a smartcoin in Chia, so build us a smartcoin.**
 
### Instructions

* You must use Chialisp on Clovyr Code to make your program, and you will submit your final code via Github.
* Create a repo on GitHub in your account. Clone it here and have fun. 
* More tips in [About Clovyr Code](https://github.com/clovyr/chia-example/blob/main/intro/98-About-Clovyr-Code.md) and [Developing on Chia with Clovyr Code](https://github.com/clovyr/chia-example/blob/main/intro/02-Getting-Started.md)
