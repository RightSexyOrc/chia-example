If you would like to keep working in this Clovyr Code instance:
   - `cd /home/clovyr/git/github.com/clovyr/chia-example` - navigate to the repo directory
   - `git pull` - pull the latest changes (`git pull origin main` if you are working in your own branch)

If you would like to start fresh, visit [url] to launch a new Chialisp environment after that time.
