# Creating a Custom Asset Token (CAT)

Custom Asset Tokens (CATs) are user-created coins in the Chia Network. 

CATs are useful to represent real world assets like cars or rare books. They can be tied to financial assets, such as "you can redeeom one of our coins for one share of stock". They can be used to create reward schemes, like in-network travel points.

CATs are unforegeable. No extra value can be added to, or removed from, the set at any point after their creation (though they can be merged with a new deposit to create a new CAT with a higher value than before). Their value is always transferred from legitimate CAT parents. The value of the CAT can be stored in one big coin, or split among any number of coins of arbitrary value, summing to the total value of the CAT.
