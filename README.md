Here you can experiment with Chialisp, a powerful and secure language for smart money based on LISP.

# Welcome to the Chialisp Developer Challenge!

The Challenge runs for 24 hours, beginning at 12pm PST on February 3, 2022.

### A message from the Chia team: 

Welcome to Chia’s very first Developers Challenge!  

In preparation for this event we had planned to give a very specific prompt; however, as we began to set the judging criteria, we realized we may have been too restrictive in light of the 24 hour window, which would limit your creativity and flexibility. So instead, we are opening the prompt up to something more generalized. 

**Make us what you think is fun, creative, innovative, exciting based on Chialisp using the Clovyr development environment! Everything boils down to a smartcoin in Chia, so build us a smartcoin. What you do from there, the sky is the limit!**
 
### Instructions

* You must use Chialisp on Clovyr Code to make your program, and you will submit your final code via Github.
* Create a repo on GitHub in your account. Clone it here and have fun. 
* More tips in [About Clovyr Code](https://github.com/clovyr/chia-example/blob/main/intro/98-About-Clovyr-Code.md) and [Developing on Chia with Clovyr Code](https://github.com/clovyr/chia-example/blob/main/intro/02-Getting-Started.md)
* Stay tuned for where to post your repo link if you'd like to submit your work for judging
* A member of the Chia dev team will be available to answer your questions for the next 24 hours in [Keybase](https://keybase.io): chia_network.public.clovyr_challenge#general 
* 24-hour live support & chat via [Zoom hangout](https://chia-net.zoom.us/j/83807682642?pwd=QlMweStJRnBKM2NxTjBlYzJTbkhxQT09) | Passcode: 287999

### Judging and Prizes

* We will be judging using the following metrics: Your use of Chialisp | Functionality | Creativity | Usefulness | Code Quality | Spirit of the challenge 
* Our judging panel will select a grand prize winner of $10,000, a runner up of $5,000 and a 3rd place prize of $2,500 payable via Crypto or Fiat (USD) at your preference. Winners will be contacted by Friday, Feb 11, 2022. 

We here at Chia are very excited to be hosting our first Developers Challenge and we can’t wait to see what our amazing community comes up with!

### Tips from the Clovyr Code Team:
- All of the necessary tools like `chia` and `cdv` are already installed and a connection to testnet10 is pre-configured
- We suggest opening [this page](https://github.com/clovyr/chia-example/blob/main/README.md) in a separate browser tab so you can easily refer to these resources while you work
- To make sure you're viewing the latest docs and examples (including this page), in the Clovyr Code terminal:
   - `cd /home/clovyr/git/github.com/clovyr/chia-example` - navigate to the repo directory
   - `git pull` - pull the latest changes
- To view a markdown page like this one in the Preview Pane (pretty mode), press `CTRL+SHIFT+V`.
